# 🕯 FireFlyFy

A simple tool to manage per-app monitor brightness.

You can also enable read mode by toggling Windows Night Light.

> This program is free, but ⭐ stars to the repo help improve my dev career!



> [!WARNING]  
> 💻Windows does not expose an API for Night Light CLI management by default, this is a bit of a hacky approach.
> 🚀 Standalone FireFlyFy CLI tool coming soon!



> [!NOTE]
> 📚FireFlyFy now supports 21 languages!
